Javascript 
---------
- Javascript always pass by value so changing the value of the variable never changes the underlying primitive (string or number). However, when a variable refers
to an object which includes array, the value is the reference to the object. In pass by reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/ addrss of the
variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function affect the variable passed from outside the function. In Javascript arrays and object follows 
pass by reference. 


C++
---
- In c++ Primitives and objects are passed by value and arrays are passed by reference by default unless the function signature specifies otherwise.   


Java
----
- Many programming languages allow passing parameters by reference or by value. In java, we can only pass parameters by value. This imposes some limits and 
raises questions. 
- Object references are passed by value
    - All object references in java are passed by value. This means that a copy of the value will be passed to a method. But the trick is that passing a copy
    of the value also changes the real value of the object. To understand why start with this example. 
            
            public class ObjectReferenceExample {

                public static void main(String... doYourBest) {
                        Simpson simpson = new Simpson();
                        transformIntoHomer(simpson);
                        System.out.println(simpson.name);
                }

                static void transformIntoHomer(Simpson simpson) {
                        simpson.name = "Homer";
                }

            }

            class Simpson {
                String name;
            }
    - In this case, it will be Homer! The reason is that Java object variables are simply references that point to real objects in the memory heap. 
    Therefore, even though Java passes parameters to methods by value, if the variable points to an object reference, the real object will also be changed.

- All primitive types are passed by value
